          1. **FLAIR:** Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery is an MRI sequence with an inversion recovery set to null fluids.
   

          2. **T1-w:** T1 weighted image is a basic pulse MRI sequence that depicts differences in signal based upon intrinsic T1 relaxation time of various tissues.


          3. **T2-w:** T2 weighted image is a basic pulse MRI sequence that depicts differences in signal based upon intrinsic T1 relaxation time of various tissues.


          4. **PD:** Proton Density weighted image is a MRI sequence where the tissues with the higher concentration or density of protons (hydrogen atoms) produce the strongest signals and appear the brightest on the image.

#Â AI Model

## Pipeline

Easy multiple sclerosis white matter lesion segmentation using convolutional deep neural networks.

- For each subject, use FLAIR and T1-w images to infer segmentation
- You will obtain a mask with the segmentation
![Demo](/images/FLAIR_segmentation_resized.png)
- It can be overlayed on the MRI study with a medical image viewer
- Here it is done over the FLAIR sequence, since it can be used in brain imaging to suppress cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) effects on the image, so as to bring out the periventricular hyperintense lesions, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) plaques.


## Follow-up

By means of this AI model Multiple sclerosis lesion segmentatation can be performed on consecutive MRI studies
This allows for the monitoring the evolution of the disease

- It will take in optimal nework conditions around 2min (VPN dependent) for a 130MB transfer with the results.
- You will get the following result

## The 3D view

- To work with the 3D focus on the yellow square 

![Demo](/images/ai-l-d-6.png)

- Click on sigle view, anotated in red, this will maximize the view
- You can hide the body layer by cliking on the eye icon anotated in blue.
- It will look like the following image

- To capure and export a image click on the screenshots option.
- Then capture active view
- You will get this view

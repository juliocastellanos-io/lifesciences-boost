        content: >-
          The **Integrated Breeding Platform (IBP)** provides tools, technologies and expertise sought by plant breeding programs in the public and private sectors, mainly in developing countries, as well as by universities engaged in teaching and research for the next generation of plant breeders. It connects researchers, technicians and students at the local, regional and international levels. In doing so, the IBP is able to draw upon comprehensive knowledge and resources that are invaluable to strengthen the delivery chain for key staple food crops.

      - title: General Objectives
        content: >-
           Providing modern plant breeding programs, with good data management practices, that meet demand-led objectives in the context of a value chain approach that addresses consumer demand, agro-ecological challenges, and local production needs. Through the enhancement of plant breeding programs, and the sharing of knowledge resources across chain actors, it envisages improved livelihoods for farming families in developing countries.

### CrossTab
<img src="/images/rice-crop-hand.jpg" alt="CrossTab" width="65%" height="65%" style="float:right">  
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the context of a collaboration between IBP and Globant, we are creating an innovative tool that will allow the breeders to obtain recommendations based on the desired traits for the new generations of crops. This application helps the producer choose the right germplasms to breed among hundreds of options, reducing experimentation costs and times. </p>

###Â Choosing on the desired traits

<img src="/images/IBP_Stage1_new.jpg" alt="Stage 1" width="55%" height="55%" style="float:left">  
<p style="text-align:justify;">The system will allow the breeder to select the traits and the value of the traits on which the algorithm will be based, and and rank them according to their importance. The traits can be both quantitative or qualitative and a great deal of selection criteria will be contemplated at the same time, permitting the breeder to choose among all imaginable scenarios. "Must have" option will also be available to filter out germplasm that does not comply with a certain selection criteria alltogether. This will achieve unprecedent control over the future features of the offspring.</p>

### Importing genetic markers

<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever available breeders can upload genetic studies onto Crosstab. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) markers will be translated utilizing cutting-edge translation tables linking SNPs to crop traits curated by experts in the field.</p>

### Calculating the best fit

<p style="text-align:justify;">All possible germplasm pairs will be passed through the selection criteria. The ones that meet the criteria get a value of 1, and if its not met, a value of 0. A confidence average summarizing all selection criteria will be calculated to enable breeders with a global metric for rapid comparison between different pairs. Furthermore, genetic markers left untranslated will be use to calculate a genetic variability index,assessing the difference in genetic background within germplasm pairs.</p>

### Displaying the results

<p style="text-align:justify;">
The possible crosses will be ordered according to the calculated confidence average and displayed as an actionable histogram for the breeder, showing the number of crosses within each confidence average interval.</p>

<br>
<br>
<img src="/images/IBP_Stage2.2.jpg" alt="Results 2" width="40%" height="40%" style="float:right">  
<p style="text-align:justify;">A table displaying all the possible crosses and the actual values for each trait will be generated, allowing the breeder to pinpoint the best crosses to start the breeding experiments.</p>
<br>

### Storing the information

<p style="text-align:justify;">The breeder can request results to be sent in a .csv file to their email for future reference. Additionally, the selection criteria will also be saved in the CrossTab application allowing rapid minor changes in the requeriments to obtain new results and compare with the previous ones.</p>

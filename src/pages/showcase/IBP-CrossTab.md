          The **Integrated Breeding Platform (IBP)** provides tools, technologies and expertise sought by plant breeding programs in the public and private sectors, mainly in developing countries, as well as by universities engaged in teaching and research for the next generation of plant breeders. It builds connects researchers, technicians and students at the local, regional and international levels. In doing so, the IBP is able to draw upon comprehensive knowledge and resources that are invaluable to strengthen the delivery chain for key staple food crops.

        content: >-
           Providing modern plant breeding programs, with good data management practices, that meet demand-led objectives in the context of a value chain approach that addresses consumer demand, agro-ecological challenges, and local production needs. Through the enhancement of plant breeding programs, and the sharing of knowledge resources across chain actors, it envisages improved livelihoods for farming families in developing countries.

### CrossTab

<p style="text-align:justify;">In the context of a collaboration between IBP and Globant, we are creating an innovative tool that will allow the breeders obtain recommendations based on the desired traits for the new generations of crops. This application helps the producer choose the right germoplasm to breed between hundreds of options, reducing experimentation costs and times. </p>

###Â Deciding on the desired traits

<img src="/images/IBP_Stage1.jpg" alt="0" width="45%" height="45%" style="float:left">  
<p style="text-align:justify;">The system will allow the breeder to select the traits on which the decision will be based, and rank them according their value or importance. The traits can be both quantitative or qualitative and all the possibilities of selection criteria will be contemplated, permitting the breeder choose between all imaginable scenarios. This will result in the best possible control over the offspring.</p>

### Importing genetic markers

<p style="text-align:justify;">CrossTab will allow the breeder upload genetic information for the germoplasm when available. These will be translated utilizing cutting edge translation tables with Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) markers linking to crop traits curated by experts in the field.</p>

### Calculating the best fit

<p style="text-align:justify;">A confidence average will be calculated based on wether each desired condition is met and the weight the breeder has assigned to each one of them. An extra level of complexity will be archieved using the uploaded genetic information for the germoplasm if available, which will also be utilized to calculate a genetic variability index. </p>

### Displaying the results
<br>
<br>
<img src="/images/IBP_Stage2.1.jpg" alt="0" width="60%" height="60%" style="float:left">  
<p style="text-align:justify;">
The possible crosses will be ordered according to the calculated confidence average and displayed as an actionable histogram for the breeder, displaying the amount of positive crosses available.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<img src="/images/IBP_Stage2.2.jpg" alt="0" width="60%" height="60%" style="float:right">  
<p style="text-align:justify;">A table displaying all the possible crosses <b>and the actual values for each trait</b> will be generated, allowing the breeder to select the best crosses to proceed with the breeding experiments.</p>
<br>
<br>

### Storing the information

<p style="text-align:justify;">The breeder will have the option to have all the information sent to their email for future reference. Additionally, the crosses will also be saved in the CrossTab application to allow a rapid refill of the requeriments in case subtle changes need to be made to the cross to obtain different results and compare between them.</p>
